* v1.1 Release

This is our first release, and should be feature (if not content) complete.

** Currencies

*** DONE Basic stat currencies [11/11]

We need to create currencies for the basic tracking numbers we use for the player.
We'd use =player.stat= entries except that we don't have access to the =player= object in entity update events which is where we have to calculate and apply stat effects to get them to apply to the player.

- [X] Strength
- [X] Precision
- [X] Wits
- [X] Defense
- [X] Evasion
- [X] Energy
- [X] Health
- [X] Mobility
- [X] Experience Motes
- [X] Character Level
- [X] Skill Points

** SkillGraph

*** STARTED Feat/skillgraph

There is a data structure called the =ISLSkillGraph= that loads =ISLSkillModule= data from config and manages the bonus/perk/species nodes that the player can unlock.

**** DONE There are skills on the skill graph in three flavors

- [X] Bonus skills are created from simple stat-based templates and add stats. They are filler nodes.
- [X] Perk skills are more significant, and represent something worth building TOWARDS.
- [X] Species nodes are unique per species, and are the root/center of the Skill Graph providing species-specific buffs/stats to the player.

**** DONE Skill Modules allow for easy construction of the SkillGraph

Each module can have a discreet position/rotation value such that you can design the layout for a module
in a single frame of reference and then when building the skill tree they can be repositioned.

It's really hard to do the math to correctly position every node by hand, and this lets you draw a line and then pivot that line more organically.

**** TODO Design the Skill Graph

#+begin_src text
                      (Floran)
                      2H Melee
         DW Melee                  1H Melee (+shield)
                      Strength
      (Hylotl)                            (Glitch)

   1H Ranged                      1H Magical

  (Apex)                                    (Avian)
                  Sniper    Pets(?)
#+end_src

**** TODO Design species core modules for the vanilla species

- [ ] Human : Balanced, No real optimization, Yo-Yos
- [ ] Apex : Ranged Specialization, Rifles
- [ ] Avian : Magic Specialization, Staffs
- [ ] Floran : Melee Specialization, Spears
- [ ] Glitch : Melee+Magic Specialization, SNS + Magical
- [ ] Novakid : Ranged+Magic Specialization, Pistols + Magical
- [ ] Hylotl : Melee+Ranged Specialization, Katanas & Bows

** UI

*** STARTED Feat/constellation [1/3]

There is a character sheet UI that allows the player to track the total stats and any perks they've unlocked on the skill graph.

**** DONE Rename to "Constellation"

The player already has a "Character Sheet" of sorts in the form of their inventory, so calling ours the character sheet is both not especially flavorful and likelty confuse people.

Instead, we're going to call it the player's Constellation. As in

#+begin_quote
Hey bro, what Constellation are you running for this character?
#+end_quote

Just feels more space-y.
One of the things that rubbed me the wrong way about RPG Growth was that it was too "Fantasy" in my Sci-Fi.

**** DONE Display primary stats [6/6]

- [X] Strength
- [X] Precision
- [X] Wits
- [X] Defense
- [X] Evasion
- [X] Focus

**** TODO Display secondary stats [/]

- [ ] Vigor
- [ ] Mobility
- [ ] Crit Chance?
- [ ] Fourth Thing

*** STARTED Feat/skilltree

There is a canvas UI that allows the player to browse the skill graph, see the effects of nodes, and unlock those nodes for their character by spending skill points.

**** STARTED Add tooltips to skill tree nodes [0/2]

***** DONE add tooltip for bonus nodes that shows the stats affected and the bonuses applied

***** STARTED Add tooltip for Perk nodes that describes the perk

**** DONE Revise =bonus= node graphcs to be (2^n)-1 scale (ie, to have a discreet center line)

**** STARTED Create =perk= node graphics and default icons

**** DONE Add working state REVERT / APPLY to enable skill shopping

**** DONE Add RESPEC button to allow the user to reset their skills

**** TODO Disable Revert/Apply when the state is not dirty

**** TODO Fix Revert so that it's not identical to respec

**** TODO Disable Respec when the user is not admin / does not have a respec core

**** DONE Add some perks

Right now Perks are an idea and not a reality. The Species and Bonus nodes work great, but we're not seeing any effect from perks.

** DONE Stats and Stat Effects

*** DONE Differentiate between melee/ranged/magical

Conveniently, most* weapons have the =weapon= and =melee= or =ranged= tag on them already.

Inconveniently, Starbound base assets staff/wand weapons do NOT have the =magical= tag on them.

*** DONE =Strength= [3/3]

**** DONE Strength improves powerMultiplier for 2h Melee Weapons

**** DONE Strength improves powerMultiplier for 1h Melee Weapons

**** DONE Strength improves shieldHealth, shieldBash(?) for Shields

*** DONE =Precision= [2/2]

**** DONE Precision improves powerMultiplier for 2h ranged weapons

**** DONE Precision improves powerMultiplier for 1h ranged weapons

*** DONE =Wits= [2/2]

**** DONE Wits improves powerMultiplier for 2h magical weapons

**** DONE Wits improves powerMultiplier for 1h magical weapons

*** DONE =Defense=

**** DONE Defense adds to the player's Protection

We're absorbing FU's 0-200 Protection with diminishing returns instead of Vanilla's 0-100 linear scaling, which is a start. But we also want an intermediary "Defense" stat that adds to protection in smaller increments allowing for larger numbers (and for interaction with the default Protection from armor)

We want to avoid the player's damage reduction going over 80%, for balance reasons.

Note: Players can stack Defense and Evasion, so it's still possible to mitigate more damage by virtue of ignoring some hits and soaking the others.

*** DONE =Evasion=

**** DONE Evasion provides a dodge chance to the player on incoming damage

When the player receives a damageRequest, we apply a % chance that the damage will be ignored.

Note that because it reduces incoming damage by 100%, and we want to keep pace with Protection, we have to have pretty specific math to ensure that the player never has >80% damage reduction.

**** DONE Add a particle when the player dodges so they know what's happening

*** DONE =Focus=

**** DONE Rename =isl_energy= to Focus
**** DONE Focus increases the player's Max Energy

*** DONE =Vigor=

**** DONE Rename =isl_health= to Vigor
**** DONE Vigor increases the player's Max Health

*** DONE =Mobility=

**** DONE Mobility increases the player's movespeed and jumpheight

** STARTED Leveling Up

*** STARTED Killing (most) monsters drops experience

**** DONE Killing Poptops drops experience

*** TODO Killing boss monsters drops LOTs of experience

*** DONE Farming plants drops experience

*** DONE Collecting enough experience levels you up

*** DONE Leveling Up is Exciting

*** DONE Leveling Up gets you skill points

** Items

*** DONE Experience Motes

I've made a graphic for this but it might need more attention.

*** TODO Skill Reset Device

I really like the idea that beating the Ruin (the first time) and Ancient Guardians drops Respec scrolls so you can respec easily after you beat the game.

*** TODO Constellation tool (Sextant) for users w/o StardustLib?

Most (all?) mods that utilize the Stardust Quickbar also offer a craftable inventory item that lets you access that UI directly. This is true of RPG Growth's mysterious book and FU's Tricorder.

* Backlog

** UI

*** Character Sheet

**** WAITING Display Radar Chart
:LOGBOOK:
- State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2022-02-11 Fri 12:18] \\
  Moving this to the backlog, it's not a required feature
:END:

Behind the player's portrait we want to show a proportional radar chart that shifts in composition and color as the player acquires more and more of a single stat.

We'll probably want the differences on the chart to be logarithmic rather than linear because most players are going to end up going deep on one stat or the other, and I wouldn't want all players to have a dramatic V behind them every time.

*** Skill Tree

**** BUG - User can lock nodes that would orphan parts of the tree

The current check for node support only goes two levels out from the selected node, which means that it's fairly trivial to orphan parts of your tree and unlock nodes unfairly.

Build out to the perk you want, then orphan the perk and one supporting node and you can collect all of the perks for #perks*2 skill points.

That seems DEEPLY problematic, but requires us to write graph crawling algorithms to determine valid selections more robustly.

This is something we want eventually to allow users to quickly select a node deep in the tree and spend many skill points at once on the shortest route, so I expect we'll end up doing it eventually.

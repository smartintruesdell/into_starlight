* v1.1 Release

This is our first release, and should be feature (if not content) complete.

** Currencies

*** DONE Basic stat currencies [11/11]

We need to create currencies for the basic tracking numbers we use for the player.
We'd use =player.stat= entries except that we don't have access to the =player= object in entity update events which is where we have to calculate and apply stat effects to get them to apply to the player.

- [X] Strength
- [X] Precision
- [X] Wits
- [X] Defense
- [X] Evasion
- [X] Energy
- [X] Health
- [X] Mobility
- [X] Experience Motes
- [X] Character Level
- [X] Skill Points

** SkillGraph

*** STARTED Feat/skillgraph

There is a data structure called the =ISLSkillGraph= that loads =ISLSkillModule= data from config and manages the bonus/perk/species nodes that the player can unlock.

**** DONE There are skills on the skill graph in three flavors

- [X] Bonus skills are created from simple stat-based templates and add stats. They are filler nodes.
- [X] Perk skills are more significant, and represent something worth building TOWARDS.
- [X] Species nodes are unique per species, and are the root/center of the Skill Graph providing species-specific buffs/stats to the player.

**** DONE Skill Modules allow for easy construction of the SkillGraph

Each module can have a discreet position/rotation value such that you can design the layout for a module
in a single frame of reference and then when building the skill tree they can be repositioned.

It's really hard to do the math to correctly position every node by hand, and this lets you draw a line and then pivot that line more organically.

** UI

*** STARTED Feat/charactersheet

There is a character sheet UI that allows the player to track the total stats and any perks they've unlocked on the skill graph.

*** STARTED Feat/skilltree

There is a canvas UI that allows the player to browse the skill graph, see the effects of nodes, and unlock those nodes for their character by spending skill points.

**** TODO Add tooltips to skill tree nodes [0/2]

***** TODO Add tooltip for bonus nodes that shows the stats affected and the bonuses applied

***** TODO Add tooltip for Perk nodes that describes the perk

**** TODO Revise =bonus= node graphcs to be (2^n)-1 scale (ie, to have a discreet center line)

**** TODO Create =perk= node graphics and default icons

** Stats and Stat Effects

*** TODO Differentiate between melee/ranged/magical

*** TODO =Strength= Effects

We want this to be a chance to avoid damage entirely (dodge) but we may have to settle for damage reduction against ranged/magical attacks.

*** TODO =Energy= Effects

**** TODO Energy increases the player's Max Energy
